A Flutter plugin to store data in secure storage:

- [Keychain](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Security/Conceptual/keychainServConcepts/01introduction/introduction.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000897-CH203-TP1)
  is used for iOS
- AES encryption is used for Android. AES secret key is encrypted with RSA and RSA key is stored
  in [KeyStore](https://developer.android.com/training/articles/keystore.html).
  By default following algorithms are used for AES and secret key encryption: AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding
  and RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding
  From Android 6 you can use newer, recommended algoritms:
  AES/GCM/NoPadding and RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA-256AndMGF1Padding
  You can set them in Android options like so:

```dart
  AndroidOptions _getAndroidOptions() =>
    const AndroidOptions(
      keyCipherAlgorithm: KeyCipherAlgorithm.RSA_ECB_OAEPwithSHA_256andMGF1Padding,
      storageCipherAlgorithm: StorageCipherAlgorithm.AES_GCM_NoPadding,
    );
```

On devices running Android with version less than 6, plugin will fall back to default
implementation. You can change the algorithm, even if you already have some encrypted preferences -
they will be re-encrypted using selected algorithms.
Choosing algorithm is irrelevant if you are using EncryptedSharedPreferences as described below.

- With v5.0.0 we can
  use [EncryptedSharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/security/crypto/EncryptedSharedPreferences)
  on Android by enabling it in the Android Options like so:

```dart
  AndroidOptions _getAndroidOptions() =>
    const AndroidOptions(
      encryptedSharedPreferences: true,
    );
```

For more information see the example app.

- [`libsecret`](https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Libsecret) is used for Linux.

_Note_ KeyStore was introduced in Android 4.3 (API level 18). The plugin wouldn't work for earlier
versions.

## Important notice for Web

flutter_secure_storage only works on HTTPS or localhost
environments. [Please see this issue for more information.](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage/issues/320#issuecomment-976308930)

### WASM support

You can opt-in into the new WASM compatible version of flutter_secure_storage_web by adding the
following override in your pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
dependency_overrides:
  flutter_secure_storage_web: ^2.0.0-beta.1
```

## Getting Started

If not present already, please call WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized() in your main before
you do anything with the
MethodChannel. [Please see this issue  for more info.](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage/issues/336)

```dart
import 'package:flutter_secure_storage/flutter_secure_storage.dart';

// Create storage
final storage = FlutterSecureStorage();

// Read value
String value = await
storage.read
(
key: key);

// Read all values
Map<String, String> allValues = await storage.readAll();

// Delete value
await storage.delete(key: key);

// Delete all
await storage.deleteAll();

// Write value
await storage.write(key: key, value: value);

storage.observeSet({
"token","name","locale"
}).listen(keyValuePair) {
print("Key ${keyValuePair.key}  Value ${keyValuePair.value}");
}
```

This allows us to be able to fetch secure values while the app is backgrounded, by specifying
first_unlock or first_unlock_this_device. The default if not specified is unlocked.
An example:

```dart

final options = IOSOptions(accessibility: KeychainAccessibility.first_unlock);
await
storage.write
(
key: key, value: value, iOptions: options);
```

### SecureStorageView

```
class Example extends State {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return SecureStorageView(
      keys: const {"token"},
      builder: (storage, pair) {
        return Text(pair!.key);
      },
    );
  }
}
```

### Configure Android version

In `[project]/android/app/build.gradle` set `minSdkVersion` to >= 18.

```
android {
    ...

    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 18
        ...
    }

}
```

_Note_ By default Android backups data on Google Drive. It can cause exception
java.security.InvalidKeyException:Failed to unwrap key.
You need to

- [disable autobackup](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup#EnablingAutoBackup), [details](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage/issues/13#issuecomment-421083742)
- [exclude sharedprefs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/autobackup#IncludingFiles) `FlutterSecureStorage`
  used by the
  plugin, [details](https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage/issues/43#issuecomment-471642126)

### Configure Web Version

Flutter Secure Storage uses an experimental implementation using WebCrypto. Use at your own risk at
this time. Feedback welcome to improve it. The intent is that the browser is creating the private
key, and as a result, the encrypted strings in local_storage are not portable to other browsers or
other machines and will only work on the same domain.

**It is VERY important that you have HTTP Strict Forward Secrecy enabled and the proper headers
applied to your responses or you could be subject to a javascript hijack.**

Please see:

- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security
- https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/http-security-headers/

#### application-specific key option

On the web, all keys are stored in LocalStorage. flutter_secure_storage has an option for the web to
wrap this stored key with an application-specific key to make it more difficult to analyze.

```dart

final _storage = const FlutterSecureStorage(
  webOptions: WebOptions(
    wrapKey: '${your_application_specific_key}',
    wrapKeyIv: '${your_application_specific_iv}',
  ),
);
```

This option encrypts the key stored in LocalStorage
with [WebCrypto wrapKey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/wrapKey). It
is decrypted
with [WebCrypto unwrapKey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto/unwrapKey)
when used.
Generating and managing application-specific keys requires careful attention from developers.
See (https://github.com/mogol/flutter_secure_storage/issues/726) for more information.

### Configure Linux Version

You need `libsecret-1-dev` and `libjsoncpp-dev` on your machine to build the project,
and `libsecret-1-0` and `libjsoncpp1` to run the application (add it as a dependency after packaging
your app). If you using snapcraft to build the project use the following

```yaml
parts:
  uet-lms:
    source: .
    plugin: flutter
    flutter-target: lib/main.dart
    build-packages:
      - libsecret-1-dev
      - libjsoncpp-dev
    stage-packages:
      - libsecret-1-0
      - libjsoncpp-dev
```

Apart from `libsecret` you also need a keyring service, for that you need either `gnome-keyring` (
for Gnome users) or `ksecretsservice` (for KDE users) or other light provider
like [`secret-service`](https://github.com/yousefvand/secret-service).

### Configure MacOS Version

You also need to add Keychain Sharing as capability to your macOS runner. To achieve this, please
add the following in *both* your `macos/Runner/DebugProfile.entitlements`
*and* `macos/Runner/Release.entitlements` (you need to change both files).

```
<key>keychain-access-groups</key>
<array/>
```

If you have set your application up to use App Groups then you will need to add the name of the App
Group to the `keychain-access-groups` argument above. Failure to do so will result in values
appearing to be written successfully but never actually being written at all. For example if your
app has an App Group named "aoeu" then your value for above would instead read:

```
<key>keychain-access-groups</key>
<array>
	<string>$(AppIdentifierPrefix)aoeu</string>
</array>
```

If you are configuring this value through XCode then the string you set in the Keychain Sharing
section would simply read "aoeu" with XCode appending the `$(AppIdentifierPrefix)` when it saves the
configuration.

### Configure Windows Version

You need the C++ ATL libraries installed along with the rest of Visual Studio Build Tools. Download
them from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools) and make sure the C++
ATL under optional is installed as well.

## Integration Tests

Run the following command from `example` directory

```
flutter drive --target=test_driver/app.dart
```

## Contributing

If you want to contribute, you need to initialise the workspace after cloning the repo with `melos`
like this:

```
flutter pub get
melos bootstrap
```

After that, everything should be set up and working!
